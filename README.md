# FGBuster & xForecast tutorials

In this repository, I will show the most simple use of FGBuster as well as more sophisticated cases. The goal is for new users to have an easy time starting to use the framework, and provide a set of examples to be extended for realistic analyses.

## Installation

First to get the repo, run
```
git clone https://https://github.com/ClementLeloup/fgb_tutorials.git
```

All dependencies are found in `environment.yml`. The easiest way to install all the required packages is to create a new conda environment via (the name of the environment can be changed directly in the file and needs to be adapted in the second command accordingly)
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fgb_xF
```
